Storms started out as "brainstorms" as a way for me to collect my thoughts on things. It has morphed into something of a "super tag" library (or so is the intent) and will become the basis for several other projects, including graphe-arithmos

This version is technically version 5 of brainstorms but only version 3 since the switch of names.

This software is not released with any license for redistribution, I'm still studying up on all of those; for now feel free to browse though.
